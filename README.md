Alright, so announcement time! First of all, I DEFINITELY underestimated the amount of content this mod adds, I originally planned to playtest 5 games under different playstyles in order to balance the numbers and was only able to finish 2 :ohgod: That said, I did say it was coming out this weekend so I will be sharing my experimental beta version that I am personally using for testing as of right now, this is V5 Project Edition, named as such based on a new type of building it introduces called Projects.

While this test edition is pretty barebones and meant just for testing, the Final version will not differ too much from it other than number tweaks. I am personally going to be doing the finishing balance changes and will be sharing insight regarding this Mod and what it adds during this following week, after which I will be updating the Github version so it can be downloaded.

That said, the mod is pretty much a complete rewrite from scratch from all past versions, and as such will be completely incompatible with any past savegames. I'l be sharing more regarding this Project Edition pretty soon.
